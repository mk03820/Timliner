							<p>Brad and Anil worked to reduce our Spectrum entitlements to avoid a $1m budget risk due to license compliance issue.  The result was a very rapid move of non-prod to BPPM for stateful monitoring.  The feedback from IT Contracts was that they were impressed with our ability to react and execute so quickly to reduce financial risk while maintaining service levels to the organization.  A great accomplishment!</p>

							<p>What started with a simple problem proposed by Security Operations turned into an amazing opportunity for us to not only give a consumer exactly what they wanted, but allowed us to venture into the AWS cloud to see what the experience is like.  Froma Security perspective they treat this service like their own now, marketing it to other teams.  This is the ultimate end state that we can learn from, how to build enthusiasm within the consumer base.  Great work on this Anil!!</p>

I really need to thank the whole team for this one.  Brad, Erik, Anil, Joe, Dileep, Madhu, Bri, Beth, Di, Dan, Matt and Jenny - Great job on this effort!!  Of course we thank Bob as well, while new to the team he had great feedback during our prototype demos!!  </p>

							<p>Really a team effort with Erik Larson driving the project for Service Assurance.  Extensive amounts of work throughout the year form Bri, Erik, Brad, Joe, Jenny, Anil and Madhu to migrate our RIT's over to Service Request Management in Remedy.  While the project is still ongoing, it is worth a Q4 mention as we hope to have the majority of the work completed by the end of 2014.</p>
